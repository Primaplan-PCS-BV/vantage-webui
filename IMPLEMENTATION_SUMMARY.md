# Health & Performance Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Health and Performance dashboards into the Vantage WebUI application with real-time data fetching, charts, and auto-refresh functionality.

## Components Created

### 1. HealthPage (`src/pages/HealthPage.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - Status badges showing healthy/degraded/unhealthy states
  - Service monitoring for API Services, Agent Health, Database, and Network
  - Real-time health data fetching from `/health` and `/p6/status` endpoints
  - Auto-refresh functionality with configurable intervals (10s, 30s, 1m, 5m)
  - Manual refresh button
  - Color-coded status indicators with icons
  - Responsive grid layout for service cards
  - Last update timestamp display
  - Development mode: raw data viewer for debugging

### 2. PerformancePage (`src/pages/PerformancePage.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - Key metrics display (Response Time, Throughput, Error Rate, Cache Hit Rate)
  - Real-time performance data from `/performance` endpoint
  - Interactive charts using Recharts.js:
    - Line charts for response time trends
    - Dual-axis line chart for throughput & error rate
    - Area chart for resource usage (CPU & Memory)
    - Pie chart for tool usage distribution
  - Statistics tables for:
    - Agent statistics (total, active, idle)
    - Cache statistics (hit rate, entries, memory usage)
    - Database statistics (connections, query times, slow queries)
  - Performance profiling controls (start/stop)
  - Time range selector (1h, 6h, 24h, 7d)
  - Auto-refresh with configurable intervals
  - Trend indicators with up/down arrows

## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching
- Uses the existing service layer (`src/services/api.ts`)
- Implements proper error handling and loading states
- Supports mock data generation for development/testing
- Type-safe API calls with TypeScript interfaces

### UI/UX Features
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Consistent color scheme across components
- Accessibility considerations with proper ARIA labels
- Loading spinners and error messages

### State Management
- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- Efficient re-rendering with proper dependencies
- Auto-refresh timer management with cleanup

### Charts Configuration
- Recharts library for data visualization
- Responsive containers that adapt to screen size
- Custom color palette for consistent theming
- Interactive tooltips and legends
- Multiple chart types for different data representations

## Integration Points

### Modified Files
1. `src/App.tsx` - Added routing for Health and Performance pages
2. `src/components/Button.tsx` - Added "danger" variant and className prop
3. `src/pages/index.ts` - Created exports for new pages

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /health` - System health status
- `GET /p6/status` - Database connection status
- `GET /performance` - Performance metrics
- `POST /performance/profile/start` - Start profiling
- `POST /performance/profile/stop` - Stop profiling

## Usage

### Navigation
- Access Health page: `http://localhost:5173/#health`
- Access Performance page: `http://localhost:5173/#performance`

### Features
1. **Auto-refresh**: Toggle checkbox to enable/disable automatic data refresh
2. **Refresh Interval**: Select from dropdown (10s, 30s, 1m, 5m)
3. **Manual Refresh**: Click refresh button for immediate update
4. **Profiling**: Start/stop performance profiling sessions
5. **Time Range**: Select data viewing period (Performance page)

## Testing
The implementation includes mock data generation for testing when the API is unavailable. In production, it will fetch real data from the backend services.

## Future Enhancements
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Historical data comparison
- Alert thresholds and notifications
- Export functionality for charts/data
- Dark mode support
- More detailed drill-down views
